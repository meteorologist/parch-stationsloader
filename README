WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

wdbstationsloader is a loading program used to load met.no weather stations information into wdb.

To run this utility you'll need wdb libraries and your configure line might look like:

./configure wdbload_CFLAGS=-I<local-dir>/include LDFLAGS=-L<local-dir>/lib wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad
